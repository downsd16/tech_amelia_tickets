# TechAmelia Ticketing System
TechAmelia is a small-medium sized laptop break-fix and MSP in the Fernandina Beach Area. This ticketing system allows the shop to run efficiently, accurately track and update issues, and ensure technicians are recognized for their quick response and turn around times (ticket times).
## Technical Stack
This project uses the MEAN stack:
<ul>
  <li>M: MongoDB</li>
  <li>E: ExpressJS</li>
  <li>A: Angular</li>
  <li>N: NodeJS</li>
</ul>
MEAN stack applications can be written entirely in JS and TS (optional for Angular), reducing developer overhead and allowing anyone with JS knowledge to dive in.
